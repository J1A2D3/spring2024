badge steps marked **lab** are steps that you will be encouraged to use lab time to work on. In this case, in lab, we will check that you know what to do, but if we want you to do revisions those will be done through the badge. 

1. Update your KWL chart with the new items and any learned items.
2. Clone the course website. Append the commands used and the contents of your `fall2023/.git/config`to a {index}`terminal_review.md` (hint: history outputs recent commands and redirects can work with any command, not only echo). Edit the README.md, commit, and try to push the changes. What happens and what GitHub concept that we have not used yet might fix it? see your `vocab-` repo for a list of key github concepts. (answer in the `terminal_review.md`) 
3. **lab** Organize the provided messy folder in a Codepsace (details will be provided in lab time). Commit and push the changes. Answer the questions below in your kwl repo in a file called `terminal_organization.md`
4. clone your `messy_repo` locally and append the `history.md` file to your `terminal_organization.md`
