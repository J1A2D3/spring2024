# Why are these tools like this? 


+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"note"}
```{important}

Remember: this is an upper level course; I am not looking for you to give me back the things I say to you.

I am looking to see that you can use and apply the things we do in other contexts. 
- sometimes this is practical: eg git & bash
- sometimes this is conceptual: eg PL & today

This means I look for you to draw connections between ideas. 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Setup

Let's take some time to se up what we are going to talk about today. 

We will talk about two main things: 
- Unix Philosophy
- Strategies to study systems



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In CS we tend to be more implicit about design, but that makes it hard to learn and keep track of. 

Today's goal is to be more explicit, disucssing some principles and seeing how you have already interacted wit them. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Today we're going to do a bit more practical stuff, but we are also going to start to get into the philosophy of how things are organized.  

Understanding the context and principles will help you:
- remember how to do things 
- form reliable hypotheses about how to fix problems you have not seen before
- help you understand when you should do things as they have always been done and when you should challenge and change things.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why should we study design? 


- it is easy to get distracted by implementation, syntax, algorithms
- but the core *principles* of design organize ideas into simpler rules





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why are we studying developer tools? 

Recall:


> The best way to learn design is to study examples [Schon1984, Petre2016], and some of the best examples of software design come from the tools programmers use in their own work. 

[Software design by example](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

*note*

- we will talk about some history in this course
- I will not take a "great men of history" approach, where I have you learn a bunch of people and what each one of them did

This is because: 
- I think that history is important context for making decisions
- Many of these "great men" are actually, in many ways, Not Great^TM 
- It *is* important to remember that all of this work was done by *people* 
- all people are imperfect
- when people are deeply influential, ignoring their role in history is not effective, we cannot undo what they did
- we do not have to admire them or even say their names to acknowledge the work
- computing technology has been used in Very Bad ways and in Definitely Good ways 





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Unix Philosophy

sources:
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- [a free book](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

- composability over monolithic design 
- social conventions 


The tenets: 

1. Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
1. Interactive use instead of batch processing.
1. Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
1. Self-supporting system: all Unix software is maintained under Unix.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For better or [worse](http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/smalley/ESCI7205_misc_files/The_truth_about_Unix_cleaned.pdf) unix philosophy is dominant, so understanding it is important. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This critique is written that unix is not a good system for  "normal folks" not in its effectiveness as a context for *developers* which is where *nix (unix, linux) systems remain popular. 


context:  
_"normal folks" is the author's term; my guess is that it is attempting to describe a typical, nondeveloper computer user_
_terminology to refer to people has changed a lot over time; when we study concepts from primary sources, we have to interpret the document through the lens of what was normal at the time the document was written, not to excuse bad behavior but to not be distracted and see what is there_



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia","type":"formative"}

In what ways might it make sense to design developer tools differently than everyday user tools? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Philosophy in practice, using pipes


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

**If you have the `gh` CLI installed and working locally**: open the terminal that it works in and navigate to your KWL repo. 

**If you *do not* have `gh` CLI  working locally**, open a codespace on the main branch of your KWL repo


(I have it working locally and working locally lets me save my terminal output for the notes more easily)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To check if your `gh` CLI is working: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh
```

When we use it without a subcommand, it gives us help output a list of all the commeands that we can use.  If it is *not* working, you would get a `command not found` error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will navigate to the kwl repo 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd kwl-sp24-brownsarahm/
```

+++


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's inpsect the action file that creates the issues for your badges. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .github/workflows/getassignment.yml 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","tyoe":"output"}

```{code-block} console
name: Create badge issues (Do not run manually)
on:
  workflow_dispatch

# once you edit, change the name

jobs:
  check-contents:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Install dependencies

      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    
    - name: Install Utils
      run: |
        pip install git+https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils@main
    - name: Get badge requirements
      run: |
        # prepare badge lines
        pretitle="prepare-"$(sysgetbadgedate --prepare)
        sysgetassignment --type prepare | gh issue create --title $pretitle --label prepare --body-file -
        # review badge lines
        rtitle="review-"$(sysgetbadgedate --review)
        sysgetassignment --type review | gh issue create --title $rtitle --label review --body-file -
        # practice badge lines
        pratitle="practice-"$(sysgetbadgedate --practice)
        sysgetassignment --type practice| gh issue create --title $pratitle --label practice --body-file -
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
#  edit the run step above for the level(s) you want. 
#  You should keep the prepare, because they are required for experience badges 
#     You may choose to get only the review or only the practice (and change this any time) 
```

We see that several things, but this output is also kind of long,

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can cut only a part of the output by using a pipe.  A pipe connects the output of one command to the input of the next.  It uses stdout and stdin files to do this. 


The `head` command returns the top of a file and its `-n` option lets us choose how many lines at the top of the file, so we will use this to get the first 26 lines. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .github/workflows/getassignment.yml | head -n 26
```
(I picked 26 in advance to get the right number for this example, this)
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
name: Create badge issues (Do not run manually)
on:
  workflow_dispatch

# once you edit, change the name

jobs:
  check-contents:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    
    - name: Install Utils
      run: |
        pip install git+https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils@main
    - name: Get badge requirements
      run: |
        # prepare badge lines
        pretitle="prepare-"$(sysgetbadgedate --prepare)
        sysgetassignment --type prepare | gh issue create --title $pretitle --label prepare --body-file -
```

Here we see a few key things: 
- on the last line it uses a pipe `|` to connect a command `sysgetassignment` to the `gh issue create` command. 
- the `gh issue create` command uses the `--body-file` option with a value  `-`; this uses std in, but since this is to the right of the pipe, it puts the output of the first command into this option
- the 2nd to last line creates a variable (we will learn this more later) and the last line uses that variable
- the `Install Utils` step, installs some custom code.

We know that this action is what is used to create badge issues, so this custom code must be what gets information from the course website to get the assignments and prepare them for your badge issues. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



### Installing from source

As we saw in the action, we can install python packages from source via git.  let's install the new version of the code 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pip install git+https://github.com/compsys-progtools/courseutils@main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/compsys-progtools/courseutils /private/var/folders/8g/px8bm7bj0_j31j71yh6mfd_r0000gn/T/pip-req-build-shqisbrk

  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... done

Successfully installed syscourseutils-0.4.0
```

This shows at the top it clones the repo to a temporary location on your system (or codespace) and then installs it from the source code. 

```{note}
I truncated this output for the website
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can use a command from the packaage. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
sysgetassignment
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
404: Not Found
```

With default settings, it says 404.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We know that it goes online.  So, for example, if you turn your wifi off and then try it again, you will get a different error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To learn more about this, lets use the `--help` option.  
A lot of CLI tools have this option.  In this program, that I made, 
the Python library `click` that I used to make this, provides the `help` option automatically to show the documentation or lets me as the developer add help text to options. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
sysgetassignment --help
```

+++

```{code-block} console
Usage: sysgetassignment [OPTIONS]

  get the assignment text formatted (CLI entrypoint)

Options:
  --type TEXT  type can be prepare, review, or practice
  --date TEXT  date should be YYYY-MM-DD of the tasks you
               want
  --help       Show this message and exit.
```
Now we can see that it can take some options.  

If we do not provide a date, I can tell you (and I should add to the documentation), it uses today's date.  Since we ran this on a day with class, before the badges were posted, the file it looked for did not exist, so we got 404. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the options to get the last posted practice badge
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
sysgetassignment --date 2024-02-20 --type practice
```

## How do we Study (computer) Systems

```{important}
This section has more detail than we did in class
```


When we think of something as a system, we can study it different ways:

- input/output behavior
- components


For complex systems, we also use *abstraction*



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



These basic ideas apply whether a computer system or not.  We can probe an object that we want to udnerstand in different ways.  

In a lot of disciplines people are taught one or the other, or they divide professionally into theorists or experimentalists along the lines.  

People are the most effective at working with, within, and manipulating systems when they have multiple ways to achieve the same goal. 


These are not mutually exclusive, we will use them all together in this course. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



When we study a system we can do so in three main main ways.  We can look at the input/output behavior of the system as a whole,  we can look at the individual components, or we can adopt the abstractions that were developed.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


 For each component, we can look at its behavior or the subcomponents.  We can take what we know from all fo the components and piece that together.  However, for a complex system, we cannot match individual components up to the high level behavior.  This is true in both computers and other complex systems. In the first computers in the 1940s, the only things they did was arithmetic and you could match from their components al the way up pretty easily.  Modern computers connect to the internet, send signals, load complex graphics, play sounds and many other things that are harder to decompose all at once. Outside of computers, scientists have a pretty good idea of how neurons work and that appears to be the same across mammals and other species (eg squid) but we do not understand how the whole brain of a mammal works, not even smaller mammals with less complex social lives than humans.  Understanding the parts is not always enough to understand all of the complex ways the parts can work together.  Computers are much less complicated than brains.  They were made by brains.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



But that fact motivates another way to study a complex  system, across levels of abstraction. You can abstract away details and focus on one representation. This can be tied literally to components, but it can also be conceptual.  For example, in CSC211 you use a model of stack and heap for memory.  It's useful for understanding programming, but is not exactly what the hardware does.  At times, it is even more useful though than understanding exactly what the hardware does.  These abstractions also serve a social, practical purpose.  In computing, and society at large really, we use *standards* these are sets of guidelines for how to build things.  Like when you use a function, you need to know it's API and what it is supposed to do in order to use it.  The developers could change how it does that without impacting your program, as long as the API is not changed and the high level input/output behavior stays the same.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



### Behavior

> Try something,  see what happens

This is probably how you first learned to use a computer.  Maybe a parent showed you how to do a few things, but then you probably tried other things.  For most of you, this may have been when you were very young and much less afraid of breaking things. Over time you learned how to do things and what behaviors to expect.  You also learned categories of things.  Like once you learned one social media app and that others were also *social media* you then looked for similar features.  Maybe you learned one video game had the option to save and expected it in the next one.

Video games and social media are *classes* or *categories* of software and each game and app are *instances*.  Similarly, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a category of software and VS Code, ... are instances.  Also, version control is a category of software and git is an instance. A git host is also a category and GitHub is an instance.  Just as before you were worried about details you transferred features from one instance to another within categories, I want you to think about what you know from one IDE and how that would help you learn another.  We will study the actual features of IDE a=and what you might want to know about them so that you can choose your own.  Becoming a more independent developer you'll start to have your own opinions about which one is better.  Think about about a person in your life who finds computers and technology overall intimidating or frustrating.  They likely only use one social media app if at all, or maybe they only know to make documents in Microsoft word and they think that Google Docs is too much to learn, because they didn't transfer ideas from one to the other.

We have focused on the behavior of individual applications to this point, but there is also the overall behavior of the system in broad terms, typing on the keyboard we expect the characters to show (and when they don't for example in a shell password, we're surprised and concerned it is not working).

### Components

> Take it apart, asess the pieces 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We have the high level parts: keyboard, mouse, monitor/screen, tower/computer. Inside we also tend to know there is a power supply, a motherboard, graphics card, memory, etc.  



We can study how each of these parts works while not worrying about the others but having them there.  This is probably how you learned to use a mouse. You focused your attention on the mouse and saw what else happened.



Or we can take an individual component and isolate it to study it alone.  For a mouse this would be hard. Without a computer attached its output is not very visible.  To do this, we would need additional tools to interpret its output and examine it.  Most computer components actually would need additional tools, to measure the electrical signals, but we could examine what happens at each part one at a time to then build up what they do.



This idea, however that we can use another tool to understand each component is an important one.  This  is also a way to again, take care and study each piece even within a software-alone system without worrying about the hardware.

Let's break the command down and examine each piece.  What piece should we start from?

### Abstraction

> use a model 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



As we talked about the behavior and abstraction, we talked some about software and some about hardware. These are the two coarsest ways we can think about a computer system at different levels of abstraction. We can think about it only in physical terms and examine the patterns of electricity flow or we can think about only the software and not worry about the hardware, at a higher level of abstraction.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



However, two levels is not really enough to understand how computer systems are designed.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Application - the software you run.



Algorithm - the way that it is implemented, in mathematical level



Programming language - the way that it is implemented for a computer.  





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Let's take a simple example, let's say we are talking about a simple search program that we wrote that finds xx.  We can say that you put in a part of a file name and it shows you all the ones with a similar name. That description is at the application level it gives the high level behavior, but not the step by step of how it does it.  Let's say we implemented it using bubble search then searches by ..... That's the algorithm level, this is still abstract and could be implemented in different ways, but we know the steps and we can use this to know some things about how fast it will be, what types of result swill make it slower, etc. At the programming level language then we know which language it was done in and we see more details. At this level, we can see the specific data structures and controls structures.  These implementation details can also impact performance in terms of space(memory) or time.  Still at this level, we do not need to know how the actual hardware works, but we see it in increasing detail.
At each level we have different types of operations.  At the application we might have input, press enter, get results. At the algorithm we have check the value, compare.  At the programming language level we need more specifics too, like assign or append.






+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



After the Programming language level, there is assembly.
The advantage to assembly is that it is hardware independent and human readable. It is low level and limited to what the hardware *can* do, but it is a version of that that can be run on different hardware.
It is much lower level.  When you compile a program, it is translated to assembly.  At this level, programs written in different level become indistinguishable. This has much lower level operations. We can do various calculations, but not things like compare. Things that were one step before, like assign become two, choose a memory location, then write to memory.
This level of abstraction is the level of detail we will think about most.  We'll look at the others, but spend much less time below here.







+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Machine code translates to binary from assembly.





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



The instruction set architecture is, notice, where the line between software and hardware lives.  This is because these are specific to the actual hardware, this is the level where there are different instructions if you have an Intel chip vs an Apple chip. This level reduces down the instructions even more specifically to the specifics things that an individual piece of hardware does and how they dit.





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



The microarchitecture is the specific circuits: networks of smaller individual components. Again, we can treat the components as blocks and focus on how they work together. At this level we still have calculations like add, multiply, compare, negate, and we can store values and read them. That is all we have at this point though. At this level there are all binary numbers.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



The actual gates (components that implement logical operations) and registers (components that hold values) break everything down to logical operations.  Instead of adding, we have a series of `and`, `nand`, `or`, and `xor` put together over individual bits.  Instead of numbers, we have `registers` that store individual zeros or ones. In a modern digital, electrical computer, at this level we have to actually watch the flow of electricity through the circuit and worry about things like the number of gates and whether or not the calculations finish at the same time or having other parts wait so that they are all working together.  We will see later that when we try to allow multiple cores to work independently, we have to handle these timing issues at the higher levels as well. However, a register and gate can be implemented in different ways at the device level.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}




The device (or transistor in modern electrical digital computers) level, is where things transition between analog and digital.  The world we live in is actually all analog.  We just pay attention to lots of things at a time scale at which they appear to be be digital.  Over time devices have changed from mechanical switches to electronic transistors.  Material science innovations at the physics level have improved the transistors further over time, allowing them to be smaller and more heat efficient.  Because of abstraction, these changes could be plugged into new hardware without having to make any changes at any software levels. However, they do *enable* improvements at the higher levels.  



+++{"lesson_part": "notes","type":"note"}

```{note}
For example, Bayesian statistics is a philosophy that treats probability as subjective uncertainty instead of as frequency.  This has some interpretative differences, but most importantly it means that we always need an extra factor (multiplied term) in our calculations.  This makes all of the math **much** more complex. For many decades Bayesian statistics was not practical for anything but the simplest models.  However, with improvements to computers, that opened new options at the algorithm level.  The first large scale application of this type of statistics was by Microsoft after their researchers built a Bayesian player model for player matching in Halo.

## Questions After Today's Class 

### when will we be starting the collabrative work?

Next week in lab, you'll have time to form groups and start working together

### Are the `sysgetassignment` and `cspt` stuff just to work on badges locally?

And they're how I get the issues created in your repos.  This exercise was to show you behind the scenes how the course itself applies some of these concepts. 

### Would it make sense to make terminals more user friendly?

In a sense, we have done some; there is still more of what is called "cognitive load" or how much a person has to hold in memory, but at the same time, the interactive nature helps.  It means you can, for example, run a command with the help option and then figrue out what you need.  There are added colors, and more advanced tab complete options.  

You can also customize your terminal locally and add aliases, to autmate things you personally do often or make it more like how you want it to be.  

*explore ideas: (do one of the following and document/write it up)*
- customize your prompt on your main terminal to align with how your think or your personal preferences
- create an alias to make something you do often easier
- customize your vscode experience and share your customized settings as a recommendation to others with explanation of what you like and why

### What is your definition of abstraction?

I use it in different contexts, in slightly different ways (eg teaching this class is very different than my research collaboration with affective neuroscientists writing a theoretical piece on a new approach to psychological science).  The most concise, useful definition I like is that to abstract is to hide or summarize a level of detail that is not useful for the taks at hand. 

### What are More differences between monolothic and composable designs?

This is a good explore badge topic.
