## Clearing Misconceptions


### Commit Messages 

> if you use git commit without a message you have to quit that terminal and start over

```{note}
How can we show that this is not true?
```

First we need to get to a path where we are in a git directory:
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ex				sq_sum_threaded.c
gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm	sqsum
hi.sh				sqsum.dSYM
kwl-sp24-brownsarahm		sqsuml
nand2tetris			sqsuml.dSYM
spring2024			test
sq_sum_locked.c			tiny-book
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we will use the `test repo`:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd test/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

to be able to make a commit, we need edits, so lets make a new file: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch example.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check it with git
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	example.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
To be able to make a commit, we have to stage something

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   example.md
	modified:   test.txt

```

Now that we have content staged, we can go on. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will commit now, without the `-m` option fo rthe message
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

then it opens vim for us, a partially outlined file for us to put the
commit message it. 

Then we :
- exit edit mode with {kbd}`esc` 
- then type `:wq: to save and quit



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
[main 8fc580d] xample commit
 2 files changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 example.md
```

Finally, we have our commit! 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Git vs GitHub

> git and GitHub are just synonyms, they refer to the same thing

```{note}
How can we show that this is not true?
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

One thing we can to is make a repo with `git` that is not connected to GitHub. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git init example
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/example/.git/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we can cd into the repo
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd example/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can see that it is a git repo

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but that it has no `remote`s

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


You could also show alternative git hosts, for example:
- [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/guides/getting-started/overview#a-brief-overview-of-bitbucket)
- [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/platform/)
