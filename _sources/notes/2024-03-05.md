# Why did we learn the plubming commands?

```{important}
If you miss class or lab for any reason you are responsible for making it up per the instructions in the syllabus. You do not need to notify me why you are missing class and I do not judge your reasons for missing class for short absences. For longer absences you may [email me to make a plan](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2024/syllabus/uri_statements.html?highlight=makeup#excused-absences).

For [lab makeup](labcheckout) this includes attending office hours for the checkout step. 

For [class makeup](expmakeup) this includes an alternative path to your experience badge.  Note that in class actitivies may build, so it is important to review the notes ASAP so that you are ready to participate in the next class you attend. 
```

You will not typically use them on a day to day basis, but they are a good way to see what happens at the interim steps and make sure that you have the right understanding of what git does.  

A **correct** understanding is essential for using more advanced features


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

While there is of course some content that we want you to know after this course, my goal is also to teach you process, by modeling it.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

No one will every know all of the things but you can be fast or slow at finding answers. 

And you can find correct answers, incorrect answers, or looks-okay-but-you-will-regret-this-later answers. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

My goal is that you get good at *quickly* finding **correct** answers.  

Large language models will not do that for you.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

**Note** I checked and confirmed that some of the assignments will be answered incorrectly by LLMs because they are about very specific details that most people who write blogs and code excerpts on stack overflow etc do incorrectly.

## Today's Questions
- What are references?
- How can can I release and share my code?
- How else can git help me? 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## What does git status do? 

_compares the working directory to the current state of the active branch_


- we cansee the working directory with: `ls`
- we can see the active branch in the `HEAD` file 
- what is its status? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Recall that we: 
- crated a blob objct directly
- creataed a file
- hashed the file, to create its blob object
- added the file to the index
- wrote the tree
- created a commit

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Let's use inspection to review where our repo is left off from last week. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

We see that git status still thinks the file is only staged, but not committed.  

From this we learn that index is not emptied when we create a commit. 

We see that the file is both staged and has changes not staged because we edited the file after we had staged it. 

This reminds us that the staging area is manual, like all git operations.  git does not run continously, which makes it faster and less resource intensive.  

We also note that this says we are on the main branch , and that we have no commits yet.  Let's try to understand why it says we have no commits when we thougth we made one

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Branches are references
branches are not git objects, they are references.  

We can see that by where they are stored.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

How can we inspect to see where references are stored? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

using ls and/or find

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why is our commit missing?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see our list of object with `find`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//e3/ba10cb02de504d4f48b9af4934ddcc4d0be3df
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

Since we made most of these objects as not commits, the hashes are mostly shared, but one of the hashes is unique so we worked together to identify that one. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then for that unique hash, we confirmed it was a commit using `git cat-file` to view its type
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t e3ba
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
commit
```
 as expected

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now let's look at what the `HEAD` pointer says to try to understand why it does not see that commit, since we know that git status works from `HEAD`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/main
```

this is consistent with the `git status` said, so this is not yet explaining

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

now we can check what the branch points to

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

as expected when the tab complete did not work
```{code-block} console
cat: .git/refs/heads/main: No such file or directory
```

it has not even made a file to track what commit the main branch points to.  

+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"important"}
```{important}
git creates updates the file for the branch each time you add a commit with `git commit`, the first time `git commit` is run it also creates the file
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we look in the folder, we can see what is in there
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/refs/heads/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but it is empty


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Updating a branch manually

The branch file is named as the branch (here `main`) and stored in the `.git/refs/heads/` folder and contains the full hash of the commit that branch is pointing to.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Since we made the commit manually, we need to move the branch manually too. We will use echo, by copyting the full hash from above (I copied the part after the last `/` in the list of objects above and then typed the `e3` before pasting).  

Mine looks like:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo e3ba10cb02de504d4f48b9af4934ddcc4d0be3df > .git/refs/heads/main
```

but your commit hash will be different than mine. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we check with git again: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

and now we can see that it no longer sees the staged file and *does* see our commit. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So we now have HEAD-> main and main -> our commit -> tree --> blob. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

## Git tags

The other type of git reference is called a tag. There are two types of tags: 

- a lightweight tag is like a branch that does not move
- an annotated tag is a git object, like a commit almost. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see where they are stored in the `refs` folder: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/refs/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
heads	remotes	tags
```

Remember:
-  heads are branches (like `main`)
-  remotes are servers that we can push to (eg `https://github.com/...`)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Before we make a tag, let's make sure we are on the most up to date main. 
First we check the branch and working directory: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

main, clean working tree is good. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Next we pull to update from github
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 955 bytes | 136.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm
 * [new branch]      1-create-a-add-a-classmate -> origin/1-create-a-add-a-classmate
Already up to date.
```

and we get the updates

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now, to make a tag we use `git tag <name of tag>` to create a lightweight tag

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag v1
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This command has no output, but we will inspect


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/refs/tags/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
v1
```

we see this created a file for the tag,

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will look at this too

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/tags/v1 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
0d6ef1d3db0729088d515b35b588f39af5b770fd
```

the lightweight tag is just like a branch, another pointer to the commit. 

The difference is that this does not move when we create new commits, so this is like a shortcut to a specific commit. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see the tag relative to branches in the log as well:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Tags enable {term}`release`s, where are [defined on github as](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases):

>Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.


We can [create a relese for the tag we made](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release). 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## Debugging with git
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git will help you do a binary search to find what commit introduced a bug. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we have to tell it to start, then tell it that the current commit is bad, then tell it the last good commit (or a reference to it)




To do this we need to have to tell it what commit was good, this is one of the reasons that using tags can be helpful 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

 there are multiple ways to refer to a point in the history

[revision selection](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection)





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
First let's choose a point to use as our last good commit by scanning the previous commits.

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

We did not need to inspect the merge commit because git could tell it was only a merge commit and did not add any changes to files; if it had been a merge conflict resovled with the merge commit, we would have had to check it. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Here we can then inspect what changes were made and figure out how to fix the bug. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's dig a bit futher into what the current status is. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
HEAD detached at fca59e8
You are currently bisecting, started from branch 'main'.
  (use "git bisect reset" to get back to the original branch)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.secret
	my_sectrest/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

This is new, we have checked out a commit, instead of  a branch so we have a {term}`detached head`

```{figure} https://wizardzines.com/images/uploads/detached-head-state.png
:name: detached-head-comic

A comic from [wizard zines](https://wizardzines.com/) that has detailed alt text at the "Read the transript" link on the [source page](https://wizardzines.com/comics/detached-head-state/). 
```

We also see some untracked files.  This is because at the tip of the main branch, where we were previously, these files existed and were listed in the `.gitignore` 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see more about what bisect did by looking in the .git directory
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
BISECT_ANCESTORS_OK	FETCH_HEAD		index
BISECT_EXPECTED_REV	HEAD			info
BISECT_LOG		ORIG_HEAD		logs
BISECT_NAMES		REBASE_HEAD		objects
BISECT_START		config			packed-refs
BISECT_TERMS		description		refs
COMMIT_EDITMSG		hooks
```

it created files for all of the steps in the active bisect 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we go back to whre we were before the biset
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect reset
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Previous HEAD position was fca59e8 add files for organizing
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

in this case, main

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
here we see the gitignroe is back

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Any commit can be checked out

We can also check out the error prone commit direct if we need to go back to fix again. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout fca59
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Note: switching to 'fca59'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at fca59e8 add files for organizing
```

This way git gives us advice on how to handle our detached head. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Annotated commits create objects

Maybe, we do not know how to fix this , but we want to make the commit easy for a colleague to find. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag -a -m 'introduced imaginary bug' v0.1
```

this time we will use `-a` to make an annotated tag and pass the message for is with `-m`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/refs/tags/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
v0.1	v1
```

we see it created a file like before



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So we can look at the file again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/tags/v0.1 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
6b459a1dcf4e2a0ecec1ec41b03d60af4043e9a3
```

but this time the file points to a different object, not the commit. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can inspect this object with `git cat-file`: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t  6b45
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
tag
```
it is a new type: tag
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and check its content
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p  6b45
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
object fca59e8cca05bb0861f9348a40fe8300b3d55637
type commit
tag v0.1
tagger Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1709663041 -0500

introduced imaginary bug
```
This is a lot like the content of a commit, but instead of pointing to a tree it points to the a commit.

## How can git help with  work in Progress? 

[git stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning)



What if you have worked on something part way, but not finished it, so you do not want to make a commit yet, but you need to switch and work on something else? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Let's go back to main
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Previous HEAD position was fca59e8 add files for organizing
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and create some work in progress: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo 'not done yet'>>example.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 we will look at our file 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat example.md 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
myst notebook example of using the code for doc websitenot done yet
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and check in with git
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   example.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now lets consider that we have some other work we need to do.  We also do not want to lose this work, or make a commit for it yet. What can we do? 

This is what the git "stash" is for.  Stash is a first 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`git stash`
stores temporary changes without making a commit so that we can come back to them. 



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 0d6ef1d Merge pull request #6 from compsys-progtools/organization
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see the impact of this like : 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then we can do something else
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "important " >> about.md 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 check in again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

make a new branch
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout -b important_about 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to a new branch 'important_about'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and add 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we'll check agian
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch important_about
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md

```
our stashed content is still not interfering
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then commit this
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'add about improtatn fact'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
[important_about c3bee12] add about improtatn fact
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
now we can go back to main
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can apply our changes with `git stash apply`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash apply
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

and we get them back

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Are tags only applicable to commits?

tags are defined relative to a commit. 

### Is the stash diffrent between all the branches or it the same.

There is one stash per repo, it is a queue shared across branches

### with git stash can I create a file on say main stash and then switch to another branch to move that file to that new branch instead?

Yes, sort of, you can create a while while main is checked out and then stash it instead of committing it. Since it gets stashed, not committed, the file is not "on" the branch. 

THen you can switch branches and apply or pop from stash and then commit. 

### Is the point of stash area just in case you do work in the wrong branch?

No, it actually cannot help if you commit to the wron branch and if you do not commit, you do not need it. 

It is so that you can save work without commiting, get a clean working directory to do something else and then add the work in . 

### while debugging and you accidently call a good commit a bad commit is there a way to reverse that or no? 

It looks like you would have to start over, but you could print the log first to remember what you had already figured out. 


### Where does git stash store its stack, is it a file inside of the .git folder?

it hashes the content as blobs and stores the pointer to that blob in `.git/refs/stash`


### how often are these commands used in a professional environment

this is hard to know, a lot of people are git novices, but I want you to have these as tools so you can be more efficient. 

Being efficient with your time in a salaried job often means you can work fewer hours total or you can get more work done and earn promotions faster. 


### why wouldn't i just make a new branch instead of leaving the changes floating in space?

One time to use stash is when you realize you started working without pulling. If you make a commit you will have to deal with the divergent branches, but if you stash, pull, then apply, no such problem. 

Another case is that in some projects, there are standards to not have too many too small commits, so this is a way to avoid that.
