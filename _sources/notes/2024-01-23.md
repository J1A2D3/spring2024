# Welcome, Introduction, and Setup


## Introductions

- Dr. Sarah Brown
- Please address me as Dr. Brown or Professor Brown, 
- Ms./Mrs. are not acceptable


## Prismia 

- instead of slides
- you can message us
- we can see all of your responses
- emoji! 


## This course will be different

- no Brightspace
- 300 level = more independence
- I will give advice, but only hold you accountable to a minimal set
- High expectations, with a lot of flexibility


## Getting started 


Your KWL chart is where you will start by tracking what you know now/before we start and what you want to learn about each topic.  Then you will update it throughout the semester. You will also add material to the repository to produce evidence of your learning. 

(see prismia or a member of the instructional team for the link to create your KWL if you are making up class)

## We havea Glossary!!

For example, the term we used above: 

[repository](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2024/resources/glossary.html#term-repository)

```{tip}
In class, on prismia, I will sometimes link like above, but you can also keep the page open if that is helpful for you. 
```


In the course site, glossary terms will be linked as in the follwing list. 

Key terms for the first class: 
- {term}`repository`
- {term}`git`
- {term}`github`
- {term}`PR`


## GitHub Docs are really helpful and have screenshots

```{important}
GitHub pays people to update them; I am not paid to update screenshots, so I direct you to theirs mostly instead of recreating them.  
```

## GitHub Actions

GitHub allows us to run scripts within our repos, the feature is called GitHub Actions and the individual items are called workflows. 

We ran the `Experience Reflection` action at the end of class.
