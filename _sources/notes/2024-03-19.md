# How can I automate things with bash?


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So far we have used bash commands to navigate our file system as a way to learn about the file system itself. To do this we used commands like:
- `mv`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `ls` 
- `find`
- `rm`



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Bash is a unix shell for the GNU operating system and it has been adopted in other contexts as well.  It is the default shell on Ubuntu linux as well for example (and many others). This is why we teach it.

```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. 


Read the official definition of `bash` and a shell in [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction)

## Inspecting an example script
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we will start by inspecting the github action file, first we'll navigate to the folder. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd kwl-sp24-brownsarahm/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Next we'll look at which files we have

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .github/workflows/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
create_about.yml	experiencereport.yml	getassignment.yml
experienceinclass.yml	forgottenexperience.yml
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then we will look at the getassignmet one.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .github/workflows/getassignment.yml 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
name: Create badge issues (Do not run manually)
on:
  workflow_dispatch

# once you edit, change the name

jobs:
  check-contents:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    
    - name: Install Utils
      run: |
        pip install git+https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils@main
    - name: Get badge requirements
      run: |
        # prepare badge lines
        pretitle="prepare-"$(sysgetbadgedate --prepare)
        sysgetassignment --type prepare | gh issue create --title $pretitle --label prepare --body-file -
        # review badge lines
        rtitle="review-"$(sysgetbadgedate --review)
        sysgetassignment --type review | gh issue create --title $rtitle --label review --body-file -
        # practice badge lines
        pratitle="practice-"$(sysgetbadgedate --practice)
        sysgetassignment --type practice| gh issue create --title $pratitle --label practice --body-file -
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
#  edit the run step above for the level(s) you want. 
#  You should keep the prepare, because they are required for experience badges 
#     You may choose to get only the review or only the practice (and change this any time) 
```

## Variables in Bash


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can create variables

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
MYVAR="my_val"
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

notice that there are **no spaces** around the `=`. spaces in bash separate commands and options, so they cannot be in variable declarations.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and use them with a `$` before the variable name. 



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $MYVAR
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



This variable is local, in memory, to the current terminal window, so if we open a separate window and try `echo $NAME` it will not work. We can also see that it does not create any file changes. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
my_val
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A common mistake is to put a space around the `=` sign, this is actually considered **good style** in many other languages. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME = "Sarah"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
-bash: NAME: command not found
```


In bash, however, this creates an error.  When there is a space after `NAME`, `bash` tried to interpet `NAME` as a bash command, but then it does not find it, so it gives an error. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Removing the space works again: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME="Sarah"
echo $NAME
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The `$` is essential syntax for recalling variables in bash. If we forget it, it treats it as a literal

```
echo NAME
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo NAME
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
NAME
```


so we get the variable **name** out instead of the variable **value**


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Environment Variables

Environment variables are global. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A common one is the `PATH`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $PATH
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/bin:/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/condabin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin
```

mine has my anaconda install, yours may be different

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can store environment variables to be set each time you start a terminal 
in your profile. 

- On MacOS this file is: `~/.bash_profile`
- on linux it is `~/.baschrc`
  
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat ~/.bash_profile
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
alias pip=pip3
alias python=python3

export PS1="\u@\W $ "

# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<

```

A common one you might want to set is: 
- `PS1` the primary prompt line. Content you can use is [documented in the gnu docs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Controlling-the-Prompt)
- `alias` lets you set another name for a program, for exmaple I use `pip` to call `pip3`



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}




## Bash Loops

We can also make loops like

```
for loopvar in list
do
# loop body
echo $loopvar
done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So, for example: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Cam Kai
> do 
> echo $name
> done
```

Notes:

- The `>` is not typed, it is what happens since the interpreter knows that
after we write the first line, the command is not complete.
- a list in bash is items with spaces, no brackets here (` Sarah Cam Kai`)


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Cam
Kai
```

and this does as expected

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When we get the command back with the up arrow key, it puts it all on one line, because it was one command.  The `;` (semicolon) separates the "lines"

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Cam Kai; do  echo $name; done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Cam
Kai
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Nesting commands


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

Let's look at the action file again

```yaml
name: Create badge issues (Do not run manually)
on:
  workflow_dispatch

# once you edit, change the name

jobs:
  check-contents:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    
    - name: Install Utils
      run: |
        pip install git+https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils@main
    - name: Get badge requirements
      run: |
        # prepare badge lines
        pretitle="prepare-"$(sysgetbadgedate --prepare)
        sysgetassignment --type prepare | gh issue create --title $pretitle --label prepare --body-file -
        # review badge lines
        rtitle="review-"$(sysgetbadgedate --review)
        sysgetassignment --type review | gh issue create --title $rtitle --label review --body-file -
        # practice badge lines
        pratitle="practice-"$(sysgetbadgedate --practice)
        sysgetassignment --type practice| gh issue create --title $pratitle --label practice --body-file -
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
#  edit the run step above for the level(s) you want. 
#  You should keep the prepare, because they are required for experience badges 
#     You may choose to get only the review or only the practice (and change this any time) 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can run a command to generate the list by putting it inside `$()` to run that command first.  Think kind of like PEMDAS and the `$` in bash is for variables. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
This is useful in combination with the the loop

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for file in $(ls)
> do 
> echo $file 
> done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md
community_contributions.md
experiences
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the `$()` tells bash to run that command first and then hold its output as a variable for use elsewhere


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we modify it 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for file in $(ls -a); do  echo $file ; done 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.
..
.git
.github
.templates
README.md
community_contributions.md
experiences
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
test hello
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Conditionals in bash



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can also do conditional statements
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f .git
> then
> echo "file"
> fi
```


the key parts of this: 
- `test` checks if a file or directory exists
- the `-f` option makes it check if the item is a *file*
- what to do if the condition is met goes after a `then` keyword
- the `fi` (backwards`if`) closes the if statment

This returns nothing because it is not a file

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we switch it, we get output: 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f README.md; then echo "file"; fi
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
file
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can put the if inside of the loop. 




```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test  .git; then echo "exists"; fi
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
exists
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $(test hello)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for file in $(ls -a); do if test -f $file ;then  echo $file; fi ; done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md
community_contributions.md
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Script files 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can put our script into a file
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano filecheck.sh
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So that the file 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat filecheck.sh 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```bash
for file in $(ls)
do 
  if test -f $file
  then
     echo $file
  fi
done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


and run it with `bash <filename>`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash filecheck.sh 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
README.md
community_contributions.md
filecheck.sh
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ex				spring2024
gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm	test
kwl-sp24-brownsarahm		tiny-book
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd spring2024/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What parts of the terminal are saved local per window and what parts aren't? 

local variables local, but there are also global variables

most programs should be per window. 


### Are there functions in bash scripting?


Yes [see the docs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Functions)

### what is YMAL syntax similar to in terms of other programming langauges


It is kind of like a dicionary, but yaml is just a file type, like json or xml, not a a programming language. It is a way to store data that is parse-able. 

### What kind of action could be useful?

Anything you might do a alot and would prefer to have automated. Fore xample in calss we have the actions for the badges, the market place has examples. 

there are also the ideas in the discussions. 

### How to stop a loop (break statement)

`break` exists in [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#index-break)

### How to check values (greater than/less than)

those are [operators defines on the conditional page](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html#:~:text=after%20string2%20lexicographically.-,arg1%20OP%20arg2,-OP%20is%20one)


### What differentiates a terminal and a shell? 

a shell is the language/interpreter terminal is how you access it. 

Sometimes they collapse like powershell is a terminal and shell. 


### How can I change the experience workflow to automatically fill in the date?

This is nontrival because you would need to edit the file instead of just copying it.  It is a good build badge.
