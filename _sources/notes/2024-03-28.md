# What happens when I build code in C?


## What is *buiding* code?

Building is transforming code from the input format to the final format.  

This can mean different things in different contexts. For example:
- the course website is built from markdown files in to html output
- a C program is built from source code to executables

We sometimes say that compiling takes code from source to executable, but this process is actually multiple stages and compiling is *one* of those steps.



We will focus on *what* has to happen more than *how* it all happens.  

CSC301, 402, 501, 502 go into greater detail on how languages work.  

Our goal is to:

- (where applicable) give you a preview
- get enough understanding of what happens to know where to look when debugging

## An overview


```{mermaid}

This flowchart describes the build process for C. We are going to go through each step of the process and inspect the output of each step to build our understanding up.

## Using SSH Keys

We are going to work on seawulf so that we all have the same compiler. 

To use it we use he `-i` option and then the path to the private key file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ssh -i ~/seawulf brownsarahm@seawulf.uri.edu
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

## Using an interactive session

Last class we worked on the login node, but that is not best practice. 

Today we will use an interactive session using the `interactive` program. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

First we'll look at its help
```{code-block} console
Usage: interactive [-c] [-p] [-J] [-w]

Optional arguments:
    -c: number of CPU cores to request (default: 1)
    -p: partition to run job in (default: general)
    -J: job name (default: interactive)
    -w: node name

NB: interactive jobs have a time limit of 8 hours.

Written by: Alan Orth <a.orth@cgiar.org>
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Then we will start one with all default settings

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ interactive
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
salloc: Granted job allocation 27371
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes n005 are ready for job
```

it tells us what it is doing while it gets ready. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We see that the prompt changes, now we are `@n005` instead of `@seawulf`, lets check out working directory: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 ~]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
bash-lesson.tar.gz                           SRR307026_1.fastq

SRR307025_2.fastq                            SRR307030_2.fastq
```

our files are still there.  The *compute* changed, but not our disk space location. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And our working directory is the same: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 ~]$ pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/home/brownsarahm
```

still our home directory

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will make an empty directory to work in for today. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 ~]$ mkdir compilec
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and go into it to work
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 ~]$ cd compilec/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## A simple program

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ nano hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

and wew will put in a simple hello world 
program

```{code-block} C
#include <stdio.h>
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will confirm that it exists
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Preprocessing with gcc

First we handle the preprocessing which pulls in headers that are included.  We will use the compiler
[gcc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will use `gcc` for many steps, and use its options to have it do subsets of what it can possibly do: 

- `-E` stops after preprocessing
- `-o` makes it write the .i file and passes the file name for it


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -E hello.c -o  hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If it succeeds, we see no output, but we can check the folder
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

now we have a new file

```{code-block} console
hello.c  hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can inspect what it does using `wc`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ wc -l hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
6 hello.c
```

we started with just 6 lines of code

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and we can compare that to the preprocessed file:
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ wc -l hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
842 hello.i
```

and see we get a lot more

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Since it is long, we will fist look at the top

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ head hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} C
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4
# 27 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
# 1 "/usr/include/features.h" 1 3 4
# 375 "/usr/include/features.h" 3 4
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and the end
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ tail hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

````{margin}
```{admonition} Try it yourself
Look at this whole file, try changing the base program to remove the include and then see what the preprocessed file is like
```

```{note}
I have set this cell to use C syntax highlighting even though on a terminal output it would not
```
````
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} C

extern void funlockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
# 943 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4

# 2 "hello.c" 2
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```

we see that our original program, is at the end of the file, and the beginning is where the include line has been expanded. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Compiling

Next we take our preprocessed file and compile it to get assembly code.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, we use `gcc`:
- `-S` tells it to produce assembly
- we will use the preprocessed file as input

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -S hello.i
```


again, there is no output
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but we can see what it output: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello.c  hello.i  hello.s
```

we have a new file as well with the `.s` extension. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Again, lets inspect
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ wc -l hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
25 hello.s
```

this is longer than the source, but not as long as the header. The header contains lots of information that we *might* need, but the assembly is only what we *do*. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And it's manageable, so we inspect it directly: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ cat hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
	.file	"hello.c"
	.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello world"
	.text
	.globl	main
	.type	main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
	.cfi_startproc
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset 6, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register 6
	movl	$.LC0, %edi
	call	puts
	popq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
	ret
	.cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
```


There are many more steps and they are lower level operations, but it is text stored in the file.

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
```{hint}
Learning more about assembly languages is a good explore badge topic
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Assembling


Assembling is to take the assembly code and get object code.  Assembly is relatively broad and there are families of assembly code, it is also still written *for humans* to understand it readily.  It's more complex than source code because it is closer to the hardware.  The object code however, is specific instructions to your machine and not human readable.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, with `gcc`:
- `-c` tells it to stop at the object file
- `-o` again gives it the name of the file to write

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -c hello.s -o hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

Again, check what it does by looking at files
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello.c  hello.i  hello.o  hello.s
```
now we see a new file, the `.o`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and again check its length
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ wc -l hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


```{code-block} console
5 hello.o
```
this is even shorter, 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can check how many characters and words
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ wc  hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
   5   17 1496 hello.o
```

it is not even too many characters

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
let's look at it
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ cat hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```
This is not machine readable, though:

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Linking

Now we can link it all together; in this program there are not a lot of other depdencies, but this fills in anything from libraries and outputs an executble



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

once again with `gcc`:
-  `-o` flag specifies the name for output
-  `-lm` tells it to link from the .o file.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -o hello hello.o -lm 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
again we can look at the directory

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

the file was a different color to indicate that it is executable
```{code-block} console
hello  hello.c  hello.i  hello.o  hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can look at this too: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ cat hello
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

but it is compltely unreadable
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Finally we can run our program

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ./hello
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Hello world
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Putting it all together


We can repeat with a different name and work directly from source to executable: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -o demohello hello.c -lm
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and run again. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ./demohello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
it runs the same
```{code-block} console
Hello world
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Next we can edit our program and add a !
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ nano hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
so that it looks like this
```{code-block} C
#include <stdio.h>
void main () {

 printf("Hello world!\n");

}
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
if we link the object file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -o hello hello.o -lm 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and run
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ./hello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
we see no change
```{code-block} console
Hello world
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we can buld completely from source that we editied and run
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -o hello hello.c -lm 
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ./hello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Hello world!
```

now it has it

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Working with multiple files

This all looks a bit different if we have our code split across files.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will make a new file `main.c`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ nano main.c
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
with content as follows
```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992

#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then `help.c` 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ nano help.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation

Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992

/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the sum of the

int sum (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 0;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total += i;
 return(total);
}


/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the product of the
  first "n" integers. */

int product (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 1;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total *= i;
 return(total);
}
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can explore `gcc` options

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First we can make the two objects:


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -Wall -g -c main.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
main.c:8:6: warning: return type of ‘main’ is not ‘int’ [-Wmain]
 void main () {
      ^
main.c: In function ‘main’:
main.c:12:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘sum’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
  ^
main.c:13:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘product’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
  ^
```
we need to declare soemthing about the `sum` and `product` functions here, so lets edit. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can get around this, by telling main about the functions by adding
```C
int sum(int n);
int product (int n);
```
to the `main.c`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ nano main.c
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
so we finally have: 
```{code-block} C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
int sum(int n);
int product(int n);

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we try again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -Wall -g -c main.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
main.c:10:6: warning: return type of ‘main’ is not ‘int’ [-Wmain]
 void main () {
      ^
```

we will leave only the one, which we will leave

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we preprocess, compile and assemble the helper code: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -Wall -g -c help.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and look at what was created
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
demohello  hello.c  hello.o  help.c  main.c
hello      hello.i  hello.s  help.o  main.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

````{tip}
One reason we split code is to make it readable, but another reason is what we just did.  We can compile each file separately, when your code is large and compiling takes a long time, splitting it will mean you only have to recompile the file(s) you have recently changed and relink, instead of recompiling everything.
````
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and finally we link them.
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ gcc -o demo main.o help.o -lm
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then we can run
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ./demo
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Please enter a small positive integer: 5
The sum of the first n integers is 15
The product of the first n integers is 120

## Why is the object file not human readable?  


https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/ch17.html#from_code_to_pointers

The object file displays as random weird characters because it is written to disk in a different format than our terminal reads it in.
It is the specific instructions (from the assembly) and memory addresses written to a file in binary.
Our terminal reads it one byte (8bits) at a time and interprets those as characters.

Today, we will see how characters are represented as integers, then binary, and read and write files in binary of strings we know to see how it what happens and mimic something like how that object file happened by writing as binary and then reading it as characters.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Prelude: REPL

One way we can use many interpreted languages, including Python is to treat the interpreter like an application and then interact with it in the terminal.  




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is called the Read, Execute, Print Loop or REPL.

We can execute simple expressions like mathemeatical expressions:


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ python3
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Python 3.6.8 (default, Nov 14 2023, 16:29:52) 
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
4+5
```
and it will print the result

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can create variables
```{code-cell} python
name='sarah'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but assignment does not return anything, so nothing is printed.

We can see the value of a variable, by typing its name


```{code-cell} python
name
```
and then it prints the value



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Characters to Integers


Python provides a builtin function [`ord`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord) to find the Unicode key for that character.

```{code-cell} python
 ord('A')
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
ord('B')
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
 ord('a')
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


This structure, the `[]` is called a list comprehension. It
executes a `for` loop in order to build a `list`.  In the REPL,
it will then print out the list.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
[ord(char) for char in name]
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We get the integer representation for each one.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

There was a question about anonymous functions:

```{code-cell} python 
nums_string = lambda s: [ord(char) for char in s]
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
nums_string('sarah brown')
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Note that it's important to try multiple things if you aren't sure the format you are getting back or to check the official documents, as Denno found by testing this with his name in lowercase.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
[ord(char) for char in 'denno']
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Coincidentally, the letters in his name all fall into the hundreds and only require 0 and 1 in decimal, so it looks like they could be 3 bit binary numbers.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Python also allows us to change content into a byte array:
```{code-cell} python
bytearray(34)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

It does not display in the 0 and 1 like a string that we might expect, but it does change the type.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can then write this to a file, by getting the actual byes of each item.
First, we will save our list in a variable.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
name_ints = [ord(char) for char in name]
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will use the Python `with` keyword to open the file so that we do not to need to separately open and close the file.
in the `open` function, the first parameter is the file name and the second is the mode.  In this case, we want to write ('w') in binary ('b'). `f` is the filestream.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} python
with open("name.txt",'wb') as f:
...      f.write(bytes(bytearray(name_ints)))
... 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

it returns 5 in this case, because it wrote out 5 bytes, one per character.
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we exit python we can look at the file and see how it is interpreted.
```{code-cell} python
exit()
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we confimr the file exists
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
demo       hello    hello.i  hello.s  help.o  main.o
demohello  hello.c  hello.o  help.c   main.c  name.txt
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Remember we wrote, as binary, the numbers, `115, 97, 114, 97, 104` to the file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ cat name.txt 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
sarah
```

but it is interpretted as the string  by the terminal.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Back in Python, we can read the file as binary
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ python
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Python 2.7.5 (default, Nov 14 2023, 16:14:06)

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> bytearray(2)
bytearray(b'\x00\x00')
>>> a = bytearray(2)
>>> type(a)
<type 'bytearray'>
>>> with open("name.txt",'rb') as f:
...     print(f.read()) 
... 
sarah
>>> with open("name.txt",'r') as f:
...     print(f.read()) 
... 
sarah
>>> with open("name.txt",'rb') as f:
...     content = f.read()
... 
>>> type(content)
<type 'str'>
>>> exit()
```

we noticed an odd behavior in python2 and switched to 3. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ python3
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

>>> exit()
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is binary, but the python interpreter also *prints* it as a string, the `b` indicates the object is actually binary type.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
when we log out:
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@n005 compilec]$ logout
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 27371
```

we initilaly just leave the interactive session, going from `n005` to the login node

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
[brownsarahm@seawulf ~]$ logout
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Would these all work the same within the kwl or another directory?

these are path independent, there only needs to be the right files. 

### is there any current day scenario where knowing how to write code in assembly would be advantageous?

If you work at really low level things, yes! Also some number of people need to debug compilers, and there could be new innovations in hardware that mean we need new assembly language

### How does one process know that the one before it is done?

What you input, is how it knows what to do, the options tell it where to stop. 

### If my time runs out in my node, what happens to the files, are they deleted and lost?

nothing happens to the file, but the code that was running is stopped

### What way is the most efficient for compiling code?

Comparing different compilers is a good explore badge. 

### Is the process for Python similar to the one in C?

No, python is *interpreted* not compiled.  However the Python interpretter is written in C. That is compiled to an executable, that we run.  When we run that program it parses and executes our code, then exits either when we tell it to or at the end of a provided script. 


### What did the extensions mean?

The extensions are to indicate which file is which, they  are a part of the program.


### What languages can we use through ssh?
 `gcc` is only for `C`, but we can use any langague through ssh.  That does not limit what you can do.  

seawulf has both `Python` and `gcc` available by default so we can use both of those, but it also has `R`

### How does the compiler link two object files together if they are so unreadable?

It knows how to parse the binary, they are just not in characters for us. 


### what is seawulf used for?

Learning HPC systems.  To see more generally about what servers are for, check the last class intro. 

### Is `gcc` only used for C or can it also be used for C++?  

[gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is the Gnu Compiler Collection and, " C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...)"

### If we write a program with multiple function, then how does the computer "know" to jump between different functions, since a program runs through the program line by line?

`jump` is on operation that can be in assembly

### Is there a "standard" compiler that is recognized universally?

`gcc` is about the most universal, but the compiler has to know what
