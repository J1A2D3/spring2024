# When do git and bash give me an advantage?

so far we have used git and bash to accomplish familiar goals, and git and bash feel like just extra work for familiar goals. 

+++


Today, we will start to see why git and bash are essential skills: they give you efficiency gains and time traveling super powers (within your work, only, sorry)
+++


## Setting the stage

Discuss your prepare work with your neighbors. Share what project you looked at and discuss the following. 
If you all looked at the same repo, split up and look at different ones now. 


- What things were common across different repos?
- What was different? 

+++


## Important references 

Use these for checking facts and resources. 

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/docs)

+++

## Setup

First, we'll go back to our github inclass folder 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/
```

+++ 

Find your PR that I opened for you today that has the title, "2/6 in class activity" 


+++
I am going to use the `gh` CLI for this.  It might not work on Windows unless you got gh and GitBash configured correctly.  

````{margin}
```{note}
If you get this working on windows and write it up, it can be a community badge (or if it's really complicated, we can talk about explore)
```
````

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh pr list
```

+++

```{code-block} console

Showing 1 of 1 open pull request in compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm

#5  2/6 in class activity  organizing_ac  about 1 hour ago
```
It shows me the number of total PRs and then for each one:
- the PR number (remember there is one sequence of numbers for issues and PRs)
- PR title
- branch name 
- when it was created

+++

Mine was 5, so I can view it with this command:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh pr view 5
```

+++

```{code-block} console
2/6 in class activity #5
Draft • brownsarahm wants to merge 1 commit into main from organizing_ac • about 1 hour ago
+17 -0 • No checks


  this draft PR https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-
  requests/ adds some example files that we will use during class
  on 2/6.  \n\n wait until class time (or when you make up class 
  by following the notes) to do anything with this PR            


View this pull request on GitHub: https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/pull/5
```
by default it shows the contents of the PR message and then the link to view in browser
+++

Alternatively, we can use the `--web` option to open it in browser. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh pr view 5 --web
```

+++

```{code-block} console
Opening github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/pull/5 in your browser.
```

Then we merged in the PR after converting it from a draft PR to a regular PR using the "Ready for Review" button. 

+++

Then back locally, we check where we are

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch fun_fact
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/fun_fact'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++

## Organizing a project (workign with files)

A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the _task_ that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project


Put another way, we are using organizing a project as the *context* to motivate practicing with
bash commands for moving files. 


A different the instructor might go through a slide deck that lists commands and describes what each one does and then have examples at the end.  Instead, we are going to focus on organizing files, and I will introduce the commands we need along the ways. 

+++


We'll go back to main first

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

+++

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

+++

Then we will get the update from main. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

+++

next we are going to pretend we worked on the project and made a bunch of files 

I gave a bunch of files, each with a short phrase in them. 

- none of these are functional files
- the phrases mean you can inspect them on the terminal

+++
We can view the contents of a file with `cat`. 

`cat` concatenates the contents of a file to stdout, which is a special file that our terminal reads 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat setup.py 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
file with function with instructions for pip 
```

```{important}
file extensions are for people; they do not specify how  the file is actually written . these are all *actually* plain text files, despite different file exensions. 
```
+++

Before we start organizing, we will make a new branch. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout -b organization
```

+++

```{code-block} console
Switched to a new branch 'organization'
```

+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

+++

## Files, Redirects, git restore


+++

Let's first look at the README file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
```

+++

Echo allows us to send a message to stdout.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "hello"
```

+++

```{code-block} console
hello
```

+++

Now we are going to put these two things together, but first let's connect what we are about to learn to something you have probably seen before. 

Think about a time you opened a file within a program that you wrote. For example
- `fopen` in C
- or `open` in Python

in both cases one parameter is the file to open, what other parameters have you used?

+++

Typically we also have to tell it what *mode* to open the file with, and some options are: 
- read
- write
- append

````{margin}
```{admonition} Further Reading
References

- [C language docs from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.2.0?topic=functions-fopen-open-file)
- [Python official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)


*C is not an open source language in the typical sense so there is no "official" C docs*
```
````


We can also **redirect** the contents of a command from stdout to a file in `bash`. Like file operations while programming there is a similar concept to this mode. 

There are two types of redirects, like there are two ways to write to a file, more generally: 
- write (`>`)
- append (`>>`)

We will use append first. 
We can add contents to files with `echo` and `>>`



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "hello" >> README.md 
```

+++

This command does not return anything, because instead of writing to stdout, it wrote to the file. 

+++

We can see the impact by looking at the README file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
hello
```

+++

We can redirect other commands too: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status >> curgit
```


+++
we see this created a new file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md			example.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		helper_functions.py
LICENSE.md		important_classes.py
README.md		philosophy.md
_config.yml		scratch.ipynb
_toc.yml		setup.py
about.md		test_abc.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests_alt.py
alternative_classes.py	tests_helpers.py
curgit			tests_imp.py
```

+++

and we can look at its contents too

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat curgit 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	curgit

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This also highlights a bit more about how the redirect works. 

The `curgit` file was created first, and then the command was run, with its output goign to that file instead of to stdout. 

```{important}
[Redirect docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html)

Note this also explains that `<` is for redirecting inputs (stdin is *also* a file like stdout and has input, like your keyboard)
```

+++
this is not a file we actually want, which gives us a chance to learn another new bash command: 
`rm` for remove

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm curgit 
```

+++

```{important}

Note that this is a true, full, and complete DELETE, this does not put the file in your recycling bin or the apple trash can that you can recover the file from, it is **gone** for real. 

We will see soon a way around this, because git can help. 

*use `rm` with great care*
```

+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++


Now we have made some changes we want, so let's commit our changes.  

When we want to commit all files that are changed or deleted we can use the [`-a` option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--a). This does not do anything to untracked files.  Thi option is short for all, and can also be used like `--all`, so you cannot pick a subset of files out with this option. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -a -m 'add to readme'
```

+++

```{code-block} console
[organization 29ffc88] add to readme
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

+++

and we confirm that it is what we want
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
clean working area, ready to keep going 

+++

Now, let's go back to thinking about redirects. We saw that with two `>>` we appended to the file.  With just *one* what happens? 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "hello" > README.md 
```

+++
Now we look at the file: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
hello
```


It wrote over.  This would be bad, we lost content, but this is what git is for! 

It is *very very* easy to undo work since our last commit.  

This is good for times when you have something you have an idea and you do not know if it is going to work, so you make a commit before you try it. Then you can try it out.  If it doesn't work you can undo and go back to the place where you made the commit. 

+++

We can also use `git status` for a hint. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


Notice that it tells us what to do `(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)`.  The version of README.md that we broke is in the working directory but not commited to git, so git refers to them as "changes" in the working directory. 



+++
Let's follow the hint

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git restore README.md 
```



+++
First we will check with git

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
back to a clean working tree is a good sign!

+++

and it looks like it did before the `>` line. and we can check the file too
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown
hello
```
back how we wanted it! 


+++

## What if I forget the `-m`

Now we will add some text to the README so we have a single point of reference about what these files are "about"


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "|file | contents |
> > | ------| ------- |
> > | abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
> > | helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
> > | important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
> > | alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
> > | LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
> > | CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
> > | setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
> > | test_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|
> > | tests_helpers.py | tests for constructors and methods in helper_functions.py|
> > | tests_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
> > | tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
> > | API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
> > | _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
> > | _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
> > | philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
> > | example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
> > | scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |" >> README.md
```

+++

this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.

We also learn something about bash: 
using the open quote `"` then you stay inside that until you close it. when you press enter the command does not run until after you close the quotes


+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

+++

This time we will add separately

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```


+++

and commit without using `-m`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit 
```


This brings us into [vim](https://www.vim.org/). vim is a ubiquitous, but not novice friendly terminal text editor.  

What is is doing is making a temporary file for you, opening it in the vim editor and waiting for you to write a commit message. 

```{important}
What you need to know about vim: 
- it has 2 modes, command and edit
- in command mode pressing keys does not enter text, but does commands
- in edit mode, it says `~insert~` at the bottom
- to get into edit mode press {kdb}`a`
- to get into command mode press {kdb}`escape`
- to exit type `:wq` and press {kbd}`enter` or {kbd}`return`
```

Once you edit your temp file so that there is a line without a `#` that has your commit message and exit, your commit gets created. 
+++

```{code-block} console
[organization 260c9c3] describe the files
 1 file changed, 19 insertions(+)
```

+++

## Moving files and patterns


First, we'll make a directory with `mkdir`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir docs
```



+++
We can see that it worked with `ls`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md			example.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		helper_functions.py
LICENSE.md		important_classes.py
README.md		philosophy.md
_config.yml		scratch.ipynb
_toc.yml		setup.py
about.md		test_abc.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests_alt.py
alternative_classes.py	tests_helpers.py
docs			tests_imp.py
```

+++
next we will move a file there with `mv`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv philosophy.md docs/
```

+++


what this does is change the path of the file from `.../gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/philosophy.md` to `.../gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/docs/philosophy.md`

```{important}
moving a file means changing its path; it does not rewrite the file.  

While it is useful to think of a path like an address, a path is not tied to a specific memory location on the disk. The operating system keeps an index of the human readable paths that relates them to atual memory locations on the storage device. 

`mv` updates that index, not the actual storage device. 
```

+++

This doesn't return anything, but we can see the effect with `ls`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md			example.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		helper_functions.py
LICENSE.md		important_classes.py
README.md		scratch.ipynb
_config.yml		setup.py
_toc.yml		test_abc.py
about.md		tests_alt.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests_helpers.py
alternative_classes.py	tests_imp.py
docs
```

the `philosophy.md` file is no longer visible in the current working directory. 

+++

We can also use `ls` with a relative or absolute path of a directory to list tht location instead of our current working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls docs/
```

+++

```{code-block} console
philosophy.md
```

+++


### Move can also rename files


We have one file with `test_` and a bunch of others with `tests_`.  We want them all to follow the same pattern, so let's rename. 

We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv test_abc.py tests_abc.py
```

+++

This changes the path from `.../test_abc.py` to `.../tests_abc.py` to. It is doing the same thing as when we use it to move a file from one folder to another folder,  but changing a different part of the path. 

+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md			example.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		helper_functions.py
LICENSE.md		important_classes.py
README.md		scratch.ipynb
_config.yml		setup.py
_toc.yml		tests_abc.py
about.md		tests_alt.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests_helpers.py
alternative_classes.py	tests_imp.py
docs
```

### Moving multiple files with patterns


+++
let's look at the list of files again.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md			example.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		helper_functions.py
LICENSE.md		important_classes.py
README.md		scratch.ipynb
_config.yml		setup.py
_toc.yml		tests_abc.py
about.md		tests_alt.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests_helpers.py
alternative_classes.py	tests_imp.py
docs
```

+++

We have a lot of `tests_` files, we will put them all in one folder.  First we create the folder: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir tests
```

+++

We can use the `*` [wildcard operator](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) to move all files that match the pattern. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tests_* tests/
```


+++
Again, we confirm it worked by seeing that they are no longer in the working directory.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md			alternative_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		docs
LICENSE.md		example.md
README.md		helper_functions.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py
_toc.yml		scratch.ipynb
about.md		setup.py
abstract_base_class.py	tests
```

+++
and that they *are* in `tests`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls tests/
```

+++

```{code-block} console
tests_abc.py		tests_helpers.py
tests_alt.py		tests_imp.py
```
success!


+++

We will do the same thing for the `.yml` files to move them to the docs folder

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *.yml docs/
```


+++

Next we are going to move the Python files that are for the "package" that we have made.  We will make a folder for this too. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir pkg
```


+++

Here we want to move all of the `.py` files that have a `_` in the name, because the only one we do not want to move is `setup.py`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *_*.py
```

+++

```{code-block} console
usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
       mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
```

I made an error here so it gave me usage for the command.  

`mv` requires both a source and target, and I did not provide one. 
+++

Once I fix it
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *_*.py pkg/
```

we see that it works. 

+++

```{warning}
Some students got a different error message, instead of being told they
had used the command wrong, their error message said that `important_classes.py` is not a directory.  That tells me that what happened was the `*_*.py` was expanded to a list of files and then `mv` tried to work on the list of files using all but the last one as sources and tried to use the last one as the destination. 

To debug, I tried comparing bash versions, but it appears that we had the same version, so why we saw different behavior is TBD.  

**this is worth a community badge if you can explain why**
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash --version
```

+++

```{code-block} console
GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin20)
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```

+++

## Hidden files 

+++

We are going to make a special hidden file and an extra one. We will use the following command: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touc .secret .gitignore
```

+++


```{code-block} console
bash: touc: command not found
```
I spelled `touch` wrong so `bash` told me the command was not found. 

+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch .secret .gitignore
```


We also learn 2 things about `touch` and `bash`:
- `touch` can make multiple files at a time
- lists in `bash` are separated by spaces and do not require brackets



+++

We can see if it worked: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md		README.md	example.md	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md	about.md	pkg		tests
LICENSE.md	docs		scratch.ipynb
```
but then notice that we cannot see hidden files as is

+++

using the `-a` option we can:
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++

```{code-block} console
.		.secret		about.md	setup.py
..		API.md		docs		tests
.git		CONTRIBUTING.md	example.md
.github		LICENSE.md	pkg
.gitignore	README.md	scratch.ipynb
```

+++

lets put some content in the secret (it will actually *not* be going to GitHub)

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "my dev secret" >> .secret
```



+++
Now we can check with git

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   tests_abc.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    _config.yml
	deleted:    _toc.yml
	deleted:    abstract_base_class.py
	deleted:    alternative_classes.py
	deleted:    helper_functions.py
	deleted:    important_classes.py
	deleted:    philosophy.md
	deleted:    test_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_alt.py
	deleted:    tests_helpers.py
	deleted:    tests_imp.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
	.secret
	docs/
	pkg/
	tests/

```

we have lots of changes, including he secret file.  it is not tracked yet, but git is still telling us that it sees it.  We want git to *ignore* the secret file.

+++


gitignore lets us *not* track certain files

let's ignore that `.secret` file 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo ".secret" >> .gitignore
```


+++
Next we check in with git again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   tests_abc.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    _config.yml
	deleted:    _toc.yml
	deleted:    abstract_base_class.py
	deleted:    alternative_classes.py
	deleted:    helper_functions.py
	deleted:    important_classes.py
	deleted:    philosophy.md
	deleted:    test_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_alt.py
	deleted:    tests_helpers.py
	deleted:    tests_imp.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
	docs/
	pkg/
	tests/

```

and the `.secret` file is no longer there! git is not checking on that file at all.
+++

### Gitignore works with patterns too

First, I'll make a folder
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir my_secrets
```



+++
then go into it

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd my_secrets/
```



+++
and make a bunch of files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch a b c d e f
```

+++

```{code-block} console
```

+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   ../tests_abc.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    ../_config.yml
	deleted:    ../_toc.yml
	deleted:    ../abstract_base_class.py
	deleted:    ../alternative_classes.py
	deleted:    ../helper_functions.py
	deleted:    ../important_classes.py
	deleted:    ../philosophy.md
	deleted:    ../test_abc.py
	deleted:    ../tests_abc.py
	deleted:    ../tests_alt.py
	deleted:    ../tests_helpers.py
	deleted:    ../tests_imp.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	../.gitignore
	../docs/
	./
	../pkg/
	../tests/

```

```{important}
notice that the paths all start with `..` because we are in a *subdirectory* of the git repo, but not the top of it. 
```

+++
we will go back up 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```



+++
and now ignore that folder we just made:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo my_secrets/* >> .gitignore
```


+++
next we check in with git

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   tests_abc.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    _config.yml
	deleted:    _toc.yml
	deleted:    abstract_base_class.py
	deleted:    alternative_classes.py
	deleted:    helper_functions.py
	deleted:    important_classes.py
	deleted:    philosophy.md
	deleted:    test_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_alt.py
	deleted:    tests_helpers.py
	deleted:    tests_imp.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
	docs/
	my_secrets/
	pkg/
	tests/

```

It did not work because we did not put the text we were adding to `.gitignore` with echo in quotes. Let's fix it and then inspect futher what happened 
+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "my_secrets/*" >> .gitignore
```



+++
Now we check again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   tests_abc.py

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    _config.yml
	deleted:    _toc.yml
	deleted:    abstract_base_class.py
	deleted:    alternative_classes.py
	deleted:    helper_functions.py
	deleted:    important_classes.py
	deleted:    philosophy.md
	deleted:    test_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_abc.py
	deleted:    tests_alt.py
	deleted:    tests_helpers.py
	deleted:    tests_imp.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
	docs/
	pkg/
	tests/

```
It works!

+++

To inspect, let's look at the `.gitignore` file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .gitignore 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
.secret
my_secrets/a my_secrets/b my_secrets/c my_secrets/d my_secrets/e my_secrets/f
my_secrets/*
```

We see that it has a list of all of the files that match the pattern `my_secrets/*` on the second line.  That would match to *each* of those files, but not to the directory itself. In contrast, the last line matches both the files and the directory itself. 

+++

Finally, we will add and commit. We need to use `git add` directly because we have files that are untracked that we want to track. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```



+++

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'oranizizng'
```

+++

```{code-block} console

## Summary

- stdout is a file, that is displayed on the terminal
- "moving" a file does not re-write the data to a different part of the disk, it updates its adress only 
- the wildcard operator `*` allows us to use patterns with bash commands
- `touch` can accept a list of files
- bash lists are space delimited without any brackets
- the `.gitignore` file prevents files from being in your repo

### New commands
```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - command
  - explanation
* - `echo 'message'`
  - repeat 'message' to stdout
* - `>`
  - write redirect
* - `>>`
  - append redirect
* - `rm file`
  - remove (delete) `file`
```


### New git commands
```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - command
  - explanation
* - `git commit -a -m 'msg'`
  - the `-a` option adds modified files (but not untracked)
```

## Experience Report Evidence

redirect the history to a file

```
history >> makeup_2023-09-21.md
```

then move the file created to your KWL repo on your experience report branch. 

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Why exactly does the mv command also work as the rename function?

There is also a `rename` utility, but `mv` can do both because "moving" a file is just changing its path. 

### Can you access the . folders not using terminal?

Yes, but I do not know the specifics for each operating system.  Usually I think you can right click or control a setting somewhere. 

### Why do some open source projects have a lot of open issues, maybe even more issues than files?

Some open source projects get innundated with bug reports or questions.  Some projects even use issues for other things.  For example, [the Carpentries trainers repo](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers) uses issues to keep track of proposals for running a leadership committee of a group of people. The journal of open source software uses the [joss-reviews](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues) repo to do peer reviews, it has 12 files and 291 open issues + 6017 closed issues. 

### How can the "*" be used consistently to move a bunch of file? because we used it with the text infront of the similarity and behind it. i'm just wondering how it's used for multiple files, because it was used both before the similarity and after the similarity.

It fills in for any number of characters. 

### I have some badges from 2 weeks ago that are awaiting a second review after changes had been fixed. 

```{important}
Do not merge an unapproved badge
```

Re-request a review

### can you close pull requests on the terminal?

Not with git because pull requests are not a git feature, but it is a feature of github. The `gh` CLI can do this. 

### If you do mv * will it move all files?

In the current working directory. 

### Are there any other ways of using mv that haven't been covered yet?

No those are basically the two purposes. 

### how often should we be practicing with the terminal for git?

Ideally, you work on badges on at least several of the days we do not have class so that you are working with it close to every day.  

You could also start trying to use them for your other classes. 

### Would it be beneficial to organize files with github rather than bash?

GitHub cannot organize files and doing do in broswer would be slow and difficult.  We will see that GitHub code spaces give us a virtual machine that we can work with.
