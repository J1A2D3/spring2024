## Admin

```{important}
These notes are a bit different than the ones I made in class
```

- Please start commenting/expressing interest on build/explore ideas. Next lab will be focused on that. 
- I will be merging the courseutils update soon, so you can see the docs more easily
- creating a codetour will be a part of many builds
- creating documentation websites is also a part of many builds

### get credit for this class toward your major


The department has decided that this course is acceptable for the 300+ level elective degree requirement in the CS major, but it requires that you complete a form called a "Curriculum Modification". 

I added a [template form](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/spring2024/blob/main/img/cm_392_template.pdf)
from Professor DiPippo (CS Undergraduate Chair) to the course website repo in the `img` folder, it is a pdf. 

Complete this form and send it to Professor DiPippo for her signature to make this course count toward your major requirements.

**the form indicates a different email address to send it to, but that is after Professor DiPippo signs the form, do not send it directly to the Dean's office (casforms)**

## Why define git now?

Two weeks ago learned about what a commit is and then we took a break from how git works, to talk more about how developers communicate about code, programming languages, and the unix philosophy



+++{"lesson_part": "main"} 

**study tip**

We will go in an out of topics at times, in order to provides what is called *spaced repetition* repeating material or key concepts with breaks.  

Using git correctly is a really important goal of this course because git is an opportunity for you to demonstrate a wide range of both practical and conceptual understanding. 

So, I have elected to interleave other topics with git to give core git ideas some time to simmer and give you time to practice them before we build on them with more depth at git.  


Also, we are both learning git and *using* git as a motivating example of other key important topics. 

 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today, we are going to learn *what* git is and what its parts are.  Next we will see in greater detail *how* it works. 







+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the official reference on git.


this includes other spoken languages as well if that is helpful for you.

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git Definition

From here, we have the full definition of git

[git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We do not start from that point, because these documents were written for target audience of working developers who are familar with other, old version control systems and learning an *additional* one. 


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

Most of you, however, have probably not used another version control system. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's break down the definition 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Git is a File system




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Content-addressable filesystem means a key-value data store.



+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"solution"}

some examples of key-value pairs that you have seen in computer science broadly, and in this course specficially

- python dictionaries
- pointers (address,content)
- parameter, passed values
- yaml files



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Git is a Version Control System




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In the before times

![PhD comics final.doc comic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git stores **snapshots** of your work each time you commit.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

![snapshot of 5 versions of 3 files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

it uses 3 stages:


![3 stages in git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

These three stages are the in relation to your working directory, and potentially remotes.  

So in broader context, the [git visual cheatsheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;) is a more complete picture and has commands overlayed with the concept. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Git has two sets of commands

- Porcelain: the user friendly VCS
- Plumbing: the internal workings- a toolkit for a VCS


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We have so far used git as a version control system.  A version control system, in general, will have operations like commit, push, pull, clone.  These may work differently under the hood or be called different things, but those are what something needs to have in order to keep track of different versions.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The plumbing commands reveal the *way* that git performs version control operations.  This means, they implement file system operations for the git version control system.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can think of the plumbing vs porcelain commands like public/private methods.  As a user, you only need the public methods (porcelain commands) but those use the private ones to get things done (plumbing commands).  We will use the plumbing commands over the next few classes to examine what git *really* does when we call the porcelain commands that we will typically use.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is distributed


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Git runs locally.  It can run in many places, and has commands to help sync across remotes, but git does not require one copy of the repository to be the "official" copy and the others to be subordinate.  git just sees repositories.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For human reasons, we like to have one "official" copy and treat the others as local copies, but that is a social choice, not a technological requirement of git. Even though we will typically use it with an offical copy and other copies, having a tool tht does not care, makes the tool more flexible and allows us to create workflows, or networks of copies that have any relationship we want.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


It's about the workflows, or the ways we socially *use* the tool.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Subversion  WOrkflow

### Integration Manager

### dictator and lieutenants

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## How does git do all these things?

Let's look at git again in our `github-inclass` repo


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the contents of the files, just the names.



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```

This is a lot of files! It's more than we have in our working directory. 

+++

We can see that by looking at the working directory with `ls`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++

```{code-block} console
API.md		README.md	example.md	scratch.ipynb
CONTRIBUTING.md	about.md	my_sectrest	setup.py
LICENSE.md	docs		pkg		tests
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is a consequence of git taking snap shots and tracking both the actual contents of our working directory **and** our commit messages and other meta data about each commit. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



### Git Objects

There are 3 types:
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's inspect the last item from the list of objects above, 

Mine was:
```
.git/objects//8e/c01b21b8d76092341a9b91e067f3526c3d45db
```

so the minimum 4 characters that I can use to check what type it is 83c0. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t 8ec0
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
tree
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Since mine is  a tree, if I look at the content
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 8ec0 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Git Variables


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


the program `git` does not run continously the entire time you are using it for a project.  It runs quick commands each time you tell it to, it's goal is to manage files, so this makes sense.  This also means that important information that `git` needs is also saved in files.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see the files that it has by listing the directory: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	hooks		objects
```

the files in all caps are like gits variables.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Lets look at the one called `HEAD` we have intereacted with `HEAD` before when resolving merge conflicts.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/organization
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`HEAD` is a pointer to the currently checked out branch. 

The other files with `HEAD` in their name are similarly pointers to other references, named corresponding to other things. 

```{important}
We did some exercises at this point in class, you can revieew the questions on prismia
```


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

We saw the local HEAD already, so we can  also compare to the origin manually, by using `FETCH_HEAD` which is updated on each [fetch or pull](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#Documentation/gitrevisions.txt-codeFETCHHEADcode)

```{important}
This is corrected relative to what was said in class, I had previously used a different source that called `ORIG_HEAD` as related to origin, but it is orig as in original. It is created when you move the head dramatically and holds the previous value before that change is done so you can go back. [source](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#Documentation/gitrevisions.txt-codeORIGHEADcode)
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/FETCH_HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{code-block} console
e3b192aa0cd490226e8adcd81d3d0b95adb5676b
```
but we see that origin head is to a commit, not a branch, so we have to follow the pointer from the `HEAD` to see what commit it was at. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

So, remember that branches are pointers and look at what commit the current branch points to 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/heads/organization 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{code-block} console
e3b192aa0cd490226e8adcd81d3d0b95adb5676b
```

here we can now see they are the same currently, but this is not necessarily true, it can be pointed at even different branches so these are often not the same. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main", "type":"heading"}

## Collaboration Tools
Let's look at the gh inclass repo in browser

```{code-cell} bash

```{code-block} console

Append the contents of one of your trees or commits and one blob or tree inside of that first one to the bottom of your experience report. 



## Questions After Today's Class 

### Why is python so hard to install on a computer?

The complexity is that there can be multiple versions and there are multiple ways to do things. 


### What is a pack? 

a pack is a compressed chunk of content created when you push or occasionally if you have a lot of content.  

You may have seen one after running the command, `find .git/objects/ -type f`. It would look something like: 
`.git/objects/pack/pack-ef31f9fc1517ed75ff4829e12728cdc8884be12e.idx`

### What are the exact differences between HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, and FETCH_HEAD?

All three are pointers to a commit, (or branch)
- `HEAD` is the locally checked out branch (or commit).  
- `ORIG_HEAD` is where your head was before the last operation. [source](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#Documentation/gitrevisions.txt-codeORIGHEADcode)
 and `FETCH_HEAD` is the last head you checked out. 


### Why hasn't a more user friendly interface been implemented for git?


There are a lot of attempts, but they are all severely limited in function and generally pretty strongly disliked by people who understand how git works.  I  would not teach any of them because I have seen that they reinforce misconceptions and incorrect understanding of git in ways that prevent people from learning the more advanced features. 

Also, user friendly is relative.  Relative to the audience and to the alternative.  To experienced devs familiar with other VCS, git *is* user friendly. 

### How does git know what files are in the staging area and what files are not?

The index file, which is not easily human readable, contains the contents of the staging area.  We will learn more about this next class.  This is a **great** questions

### When we switch branches how does it update that list of files in the staging area?

No, the staging area is separate from branches.  This is useful though.  For example, you could add files to the staging area, then use git status and realize you are stil on main when you wanted to commit to a branch.  You can then create and switch to the new branch, and finish the commit, without having to unstage and start over. 

### if github didn't exist, where would git be used?

Other popular git hosts  are bitbucket and gitlab, but there are lots and you can host your own. 

**this is a good explore topic**

### Does the HEAD just point to the most recent commit for the entire repository?

not always, but most of the time yes.  It points to what is currently checked out. 

We will be working with this more over the next few classes, so this is okay to be a little unclear because there will be more time to work with this.
