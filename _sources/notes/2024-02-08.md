- There is a bonus for getting 6 badges completed (do not have to be approved) by 2/15. 


## Defining terms



A commit is the most important unit of git. Later we will talk about what git as a whole is in more detail, but understanding a commit is essential to understanding how to fix things using git. 

+++


In CS we often have multiple, overlapping definitions for a term depending on our goal. 

In intro classes, we try really hard to only use one definition for each term to let you focus. 

Now we need to contend with multiple definitions


+++

These definitons could be based on 
- what it conceptually represents
- its role in a larger system
- what its parts are
- how it is implemented


+++


for a commit, today, we are going to go through all of these, with lighter treatment on the implementation for today, and more detail later. 


+++


## Conceptually, a commit is a snapshot

![storing data as snapshots over time](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)



+++


## A commit is the basic unit of what git manages

All other git things are defined relative to commits


- branches are pointers to commits
- tags are pointers to commits
- trees are how file path/organization information is stored for a commit
- blobs are how files contents are stored when a commit is made


+++


## Parts of a commit

We will learn about the structure of a commit by inspecting it. 




+++
First we will go back to our `gh-inclass` repo

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm/
```

+++

We can use `git log` to view past commits



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

commit fca59e8cca05bb0861f9348a40fe8300b3d55637 (origin/organizing_ac)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Tue Feb 6 11:21:21 2024 -0500

    add files for organizing

commit 1e2a45fbca5ce7bf775827f5f4dbe23b6561cff4 (my_branch_cehckoutb, my_branch)
```

here we see some parts: 
- hash (the long alphanumeric string)
- (if merge)
- author
- time stamp
- message

but we know commits are supposed to represent some content and we have no information about that in this view

+++

the hash is the *unique identifier* of each commit

+++


we can view individual commits with `git cat-file` and at least 4 
characters of the hash or enough to be unique.  We will try 4 characters 
and I will use the last visible commit above (`1e2a45fbca5ce7bf775827f5f4dbe23b6561cff4`)

`git cat-file` has  different modes:
- `-p` for pretty print
- `-t` to return the type
  
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 1e2a 
```

### What is the PGP signature?

[Signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) are extra authentication that you are who you say you are. 

The commits that are labeled with the `verified` tag on GitHub.com





+++

If we pick a commit from the history on GitHub that does not have `verified` on it, then we can see it does not have the PGP signature

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p fca59e8cca05bb0861f9348a40fe8300b3d55637

```


## How are commits implemented?

commits are stored in the `.git` directory as files.  git itself *is* a file system, or a way of storing information.  


+++

Everything the git program uses is stored in the `.git` directory, you can think of that like all of the variables the program would need if it ran all the time. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/
```

+++

```{code-block} console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	hooks		objects
```

the ones in all caps are files and the others are folders. 
+++

Most of the content is in th `objects` folder, git objects are the items that get stores. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/objects/
```

+++

```{code-block} console
00	26	3c	74	86	9e	d3	f5
05	29	42	76	8c	9f	d5	f9
07	2b	5b	79	8e	aa	d8	fc
0c	2d	63	7a	93	ab	e0	info
1e	39	67	7e	9b	b0	e3	pack
1f	3a	6b	81	9d	c8	ed
```

We see a lot more folders here than we had commits.  This is because there are three types of objects. 

+++

```{mermaid}

classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```






+++

Each of those folders is the first 2 digits of at least one hash, or 
unique identifier for an object. We can list what is in one of those folders

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/objects/26
```

+++

```{code-block} console
0c9c309922970f80bfa2c93cc23bcfbb962740
```

Mine has just one, most will in a small repo like this, but it could be mroe than one. 

+++

We can look at the plain file using `cat`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/objects/26/0c9c309922970f80bfa2c93cc23bcfbb962740 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
x??Aj?0{?+?	+)?JJ?=??`??ņ?.?L??:O?i```d??C??ћ*`?*?h4L?"?kP???b%?LQJ??&Wv??qm?ōGx£??nÁ?p?}o?Y??	???%PF8aBt?????UݤM?Bl????%?Ko 
```

The content of the file is stored in binary. 

+++

To be able to read it we have to use the plumbing command. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 260c
```

+++


```{code-block} console
parent 29ffc88519103085ed3a2ab01cffb3c99d70fc6a
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1707242780 -0500
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1707242780 -0500

describe the files
```

then we can see the object, mine is a commit, so I see the info like before. 

Some of us picked an object that wa a tree or a blob instead. 


+++
We can also check the type

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t 260c 
```

+++

```{code-block} console
commit
```

+++


## Commit messages are essential 



A git commit message must exist and is *always* for people, but can also be for machines. 


+++


the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a format of commits

if you use this, then you can use automated tools to generate a full change log when you release code


[Tooling and examples of conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/)


+++

## Using a codespace

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) are a virutal machine that you can use VSCode on in browser.  You only have VSCode access to this system, but VSCode with the terminal is a lot of power. 

+++

If VSCode is new to you, use their documentation of the [VSCode interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to get oriented to the different parts of the screen. 


+++

Before we open a code space, we will first push our content. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++

```{code-block} console
fatal: The current branch organization has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin organization

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

```

+++

We follow what it says to do next. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push --set-upstream origin organization
```

+++

```{code-block} console
Enumerating objects: 14, done.
Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.

Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.

Total 12 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0

To https://github.com/compsys-progtools/gh-inclass-sp24-brownsarahm.git
 * [new branch]      organization -> organization
branch 'organization' set up to track 'origin/organization'.
```
+++

Now we will go to our browser. 


1. Navigate to your github inclass repo on Github.com
2. Use the green code button to open a new codespace on main. 

+++



a codespace is a virutal machine on a cloud platform, not cloud access to github.com this means: 


- you need to commit changes
- codespace is linux

+++


**this is why i teach bash**

as developers, we will all interact with linux/unix at times, so bash is the best shell to know if you only know one or do not want to switch between multiple



+++

Here we can use the `gh` CLI, this allows us to use a terminal to do github operations instead of only `git` commands. 

+++

When we open a new code space, we get a fresh clone of the repo on the virtual machine. 

One consequence of this is that if we list the branches, we only have one:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch
```

+++

We have to list the remote branches, with the `-r` option 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -r
```
+++

```{code-block} console
  origin/2-create-an-about-file
  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  origin/fun_fact
  origin/main
  origin/organization
  origin/organizing_ac
```
+++

Then we can check out one of the listed branches and make a local copy of the branch with `gitcheckout` 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout organization
```

+++
Once we are on a branch, we can open a PR

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh pr create
```

It then prompts you how to make the PR
+++

And we can merge from there too

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh pr merge
```
